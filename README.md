*CyberGuard-AI System Architecture: End-to-end AI-powered WAF deployment, ML engine, dashboard, and cloud integration.*

The CyberGuard AI system is built on a microservices architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and performance. The system consists of multiple layers working together to provide comprehensive web application protection:

### Core Components
- **Load Balancer Layer**: Nginx-based reverse proxy for traffic distribution
- **WAF Processing Nodes**: Multiple instances for high availability
- **ML Engine**: TensorFlow/PyTorch-based threat detection models
- **Database Layer**: MongoDB for data persistence and Redis for caching
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Real-time dashboards and alerting system
- **API Gateway**: RESTful APIs for configuration and management
